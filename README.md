# Smart Food Expiration Tracker

A new Flutter project.

Wastage of food at the consumerâ€™s end is also due to excess buying. Wastage also takes place
due to confusion over labels showing best before and best use by date. Also, wastage of
money. Consuming expired products might lead to severe health problems such as food
poisoning.

This project proposes a model that will keep track of the quality of food products using image
processing with the help of MobileNet Architecture. It also provides the feature to track
expiry dates with the help of our mobile app. Thus, preventing health-related issues and deter
wastage of food. 

This application will be useful for people by allowing the app to keep track
of the quality of food supplies, keeping an eye on expiration dates of products, and
replenishing the stock of food. This app can scan barcodes to speed up the work. The
application will also provide notifications before the expiration date and will never let the
food go to waste.
